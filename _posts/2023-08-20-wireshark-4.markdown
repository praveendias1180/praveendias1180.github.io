# Pre Master Key

A pre-master secret key is generated by the client and used by the server to derive a master key that encrypts the session traffic. Itâ€™s the current standard in cryptography and is usually implemented via Diffie-Hellman.

```
vi ~/.bashrc
```

```
export SSLKEYLOGFILE=~/.ssl-key.log
```

```
echo $SSLKEYLOGFILE
killall google-chrome-stable
google-chrome-stable &
cat $SSLKEYLOGFILE
```
